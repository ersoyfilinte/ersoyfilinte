I’m Ersoy Filinte and 30 years old. I graduated from Mathematical Engineering at Yıldız Technical University. I have been working on software for approximately 19 years since I started at the age of 11, yet I have 12 years of professional experience on software languages. I grasp the principle of software and have deep understanding of programming concepts, thus its easy to adapt to new software technologies for me. I have also in-depth experience on UI/UX design and DevOps in addition to software development.
