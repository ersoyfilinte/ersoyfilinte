Hi, I’m Ersoy Filinte and 29 years old. I graduated from Mathematical Engineering at Yıldız Technical University. I have been working on software for approximately 19 years since i started at the age of 11, yet I have 11 years of professional experience on software languages. I grasp the principle of software and have deep understanding of programming concepts, thus its easy to adapt to new software technologies for me. I have also in-depth experience on ui/ux design and DevOps in addition to software development.
